    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have been a hot topic and one of the popular investment vehicles for the past decade. One of the advantages of investing in ETFs is cheap. Instead of buying at least a block (100 shares) for a stock, investors can buy only one share of ETFs. In addition, investors can enjoy investing in the stock market with lower risks, as ETFs are well diversified. However, which ETF is the best for investors? Someone may guess the best EFT probably is the index funds like S&P 500 or Nasdaq. But how about the combination of both? People also say gold is a great hedging asset. Is that true when investing in ETFs? This project will find the answers from only one angle, building a maximum Sharpe ratio portfolio (MSRP) with the selected ETFs from the past ten years."

    "# Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "A portfolio's risk can be measured by the fluctuation of its return, a so-called standard deviation. Therefore, a higher standard deviation portfolio should be more risk to investors. Additionally, as we know, a portfolio with higher risk should be compensated by a higher return. Hence, the Sharpe ratio is intuitive and straightforward for selecting a portfolio, as the ratio is calculated by portfolio weighted average return divided by its standard deviation. And we want to find out a portfolio with a maximum Sharpe ratio, balancing its risk with return. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the project, I will get the MSRP by using the brute force method to find out the Sharpe ratio for each asset allocation for each ETF combination. First of all, I will use a nested for loop to get all possible asset combinations from the data frame and calculate the variance and standard deviation for each asset and the correlation between the assets in the portfolio so as the portfolio variance. Next, I will calculate the Sharpe ratios for each asset allocation with an incremental of 1%. Finally, I will get the MSRP from all possible asset combinations by sorting out the data frame containing the MSRPs for each asset combination and their allocation.\n"

    "# ETFs Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the ETF Database (etfdb.com), there are many ETFs available in the market, but in this project, I only picked 15. I choose 11 sectors ETFs since the financial market has 11 sectors; two index ETFs, SPY and QQQ; one from equity ETFs, Vanguard Value ETF (VTV), since the two index ETFs are growth equities; and gold ETF (GDX). However, they are still many ETF selections in each sector or category. For example, for the S&P 500 ETFs, except for SPY from SPDR, there are IVV from iShares and VOO from Vanguard. The only standard for picking ETFs in each category is their popularity, defined by their total assets and average volumes. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the 15 ETFs are XLY, XLP, XLE, XLF, XLV, XLI, VNQ, VOX, XLU, VEA, VWO, SPY, QQQ, VTV, and GDX.\n"

    "# Result\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see from the results from two assets, the MSRP is formed with 67% in QQQ and 33% in XLU, giving an average monthly return of 1.408% with a Sharpe ratio of 0.39427. And surprisingly, the portfolio combining the two index ETFs, QQQ and SPY, is not showing in the list. In other words, investing in these two ETFs together, from the MSRP perspective, is not a wise choice because the return is not high enough to cover the risk. If we look at the two indexes, we will see that many companies overlap, resulting in higher portfolio standard deviation due to a higher correlation between the two ETFs. On the other hand, gold (GDX) is not a good ETF selection to form an MSRP with the other 14 ETFs because gold price doesn't change much in the past ten years. Therefore, creating a portfolio with gold within this specific time frame does not provide a portfolio with a good Sharpe ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the MSRP result changes when I add one more asset into the portfolio. The MSRP is formed with 57% in QQQ, 29% in XLU, and 14% in XLV, giving an average monthly return of 1.379% with a Sharpe ratio of 0.39629. The MSRP with three assets has a 2% lower monthly return than the MSRP with two assets but 2.7% lower in standard deviation, giving a slightly higher Sharpe ratio. Furthermore, the MSRP result from four-assets is the same as three-assets.\n",

    "The MSRP is straightforward, and the method can be applied to forming a portfolio with other assets, such as T-bills, bonds, and stocks. Even with limitations, this project only demonstrates how to build an MSRP with different assets and finds the MSPR within the fifteen assets. Therefore, investing should be cautious, and I do not take responsibility for losing money based on my results and the method.\n"
